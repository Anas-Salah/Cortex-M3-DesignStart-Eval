    Shell files are output by \c cbuild and used by the ARM CycleModels shell.
    Currently, the only shell files that exist are the database files,
    libdesign.symtab.db and libdesign.io.db. By default, the current
    working directory is searched; this function overrides this default.

    Both forward and backslashed directories are supported on

    ARM CycleModels shell files. This can be in list format where each directory
    is separated by a colon (:) with no whitespace on unix. For
    windows applications, each directory is separated by a semicolon

    description of these levels.

    You can increase the severity of any message. You can decrease the
    severity of any message except those messages at the Fatal or Error level.

    To suppress a message, pass in eCarbonMsgSuppress as the severity.
    Note that fatal messages cannot be changed or suppressed.

    \warning If you increase the severity of a message to Fatal or Error,
    it cannot be decreased on a subsequent call.

    \param context A valid object ID or NULL. Either will change the
    message severity for all contexts.

    printed, \a msgNumber is listed immediately after the severity keyword.
    For example 1234 is the \a msgNumber in the message: <tt>design.v:20: Error 1234:</tt>.
    \param severity The new severity level.
    \retval eCarbon_OK If the change was successful.

      You may add one or more callback functions that trigger when

      The registered callback functions are called in the order in

      \note ARM CycleModels does not check for duplicate registration of
      callbacks.  Registering a function more than once will result in
      multiple callbacks.

      \note Currently, only examine operations are supported during the execution
      of any callback function (carbonExamine(), carbonExamineMemory(), etc.).
      If you would like to perform a deposit operation, the callback can
      set a flag that can be examined once carbonSchedule() returns.

      functions executed a deposit operation, the operation after its
      return is undefined.

      The return from the last $finish callback function associated with
      a $finish statement will cause an immediate return from carbonSchedule().
      At that point, no additional calls to carbonSchedule() are allowed.

    For long simulations, it may be necessary to stop writing waveform
    data to one file and open another to continue. When this function
    initiates, it opens an FSDB file \<string\>_0.fsdb. When the specified file
    limit is reached, this file will be closed and \<string\>_1.fsdb will be
    opened. This process will continue until the specified maximum number of
    files is reached, at which point the file index is returned to 0

    This function may be called only once--multiple sets of waveform files

    By default, the fsdb writer uses file synchronization. If you

    \param fileNamePrefix The waveforms will be dumped to files
    beginning with this string followed by _\<num\>.fsdb, where num is the
    current file index. Num begins at 0 and increases by one when an
    FSDB file reaches its megabyte limit. If the maximum number of
    files has been reached, the file index is reset to 0, and the file
    is overwritten.
    \param timescale User-specified timescale. This timescale is the

    time points.
    \param limitMegs The size limit in megabytes for an FSDB file.
    Once the limit is reached, the file index is increased, and a new

    \brief Add user data to an FSDB waveform.

    carbonDumpVars() and carbonDumpVar() dump only design nets that
    can be found in the design compiled by the ARM CycleModels compiler. Use this function
    to incorporate data into the waveform and represent your environment
    more completely. This allows you to correlate the extraneous data in
    time with the ARM Cycle Models model. Unlike carbonDumpVars() and carbonDumpVar(),
    which cannot be called a second time once a carbonSchehdule() has been called,
    this function can be called at any time after the FSDB waveform has been
    initialized.

    Note that the lbitnum and rbitnum are used to calculate the number
    of elements of the data type that is specified. So for scalars,
    integers, and reals, lbitnum and rbitnum should be equal.

    For logic value arrays (01xz, etc.), CarbonLogicByteType is used
    to represent FSDB logic values. Therefore, create an array of
    CarbonLogicByteTypes and set the value of the logic array with
    CarbonBitType.

    For example:
    \code
    // 2 bit vector
    CarbonLogicByteType* vec2 = new CarbonLogicByteType[2];
    vec2[0] = eCARBON_BT_VCD_0;
    vec2[1] = eCARBON_BT_VCD_Z;
    // pass vec2 as the CarbonClientData for carbonAddUserData
    carbonAddUserData(waveContext,
                      eCARBON_VT_VCD_REG,
                      eCarbonVarDirectionImplicit,
                      eCARBON_DT_VERILOG_STANDARD,
                      1, 0,
                      vec2,
                      "myreg",
                      eCARBON_BYTES_PER_BIT_1B,
                      "top.data",
                      ".");

    // ...
    \endcode

    Example of an integer as user data:
    \code
    int myInt;
    carbonAddUserData(waveContext,
                      eCARBON_VT_VCD_INTEGER,
                      eCarbonVarDirectionImplicit,
                      eCARBON_DT_VERILOG_INTEGER,
                      0, 0, // msb and lsb are the same
                      &myInt,
                      "myInt",
                      eCARBON_BYTES_PER_BIT_4B,
                      "top.data",
                      ".");
    \endcode

    Example of a real number as user data:
    \code
    CarbonReal myDouble; // a 'double' is fine, too
    carbonAddUserData(waveContext,
                      eCARBON_VT_VCD_REAL,
                      eCarbonVarDirectionImplicit,
                      eCARBON_DT_VERILOG_REAL,
                      0, 0, // msb and lsb are the same
                      &myDouble,
                      "myDouble",
                      eCARBON_BYTES_PER_BIT_8B,
                      "top.data",
                      ".");
    \endcode

    The data wave ID should be freed with carbonFreeWaveUserData()
    if the data becomes invalid.

    \warning This function is valid only if carbonWaveInitFSDB() has
    been called. This function does not work with the VCD format.

    The dumping of FSDB waveforms is not supported in a multi-threaded
    environment.

    \param waveContext An initialized wave object.
    \param netType The variable type.
    \param direction Direction of the signal. If unknown use
    eCarbonVarDirectionImplicit.
    \param dataType The datatype used to represent the value.
    \param lbitnum The left side of the range of the vector. If a
    scalar, integer, or real lbitnum and rbitnum should be equal.
    \param rbitnum The right side of the range of the vector. If a
    scalar, integer, or real lbitnum and rbitnum should be equal.
    \param data The virtual address of the data to add to the
    waveform. If this function is called more than once with the same
    data but different hierarchical paths, the paths are aliased
    together. The data type and value representation must conform to
    FSDB data types. For example, if the data type is a logic data
    type, it must use CarbonBitType to represent the 0/1/x/z
    value. The CarbonBitType will be translated to the appropriate
    fsdb bit type.
    \param varName The name of the variable. This will be placed in
    the given scope name.
    \param bpb Bytes per bit represented by the datatype. You must
    correctly specify the bytes per bit of all datatypes including any
    non-portable datatypes (such as float, long, and any user-defined
    types).
    \param fullPathScopeName The full hierarchical path to scope that
    contains varName.
    \param scopeSeparator String representing the scope separator,
    used to parse fullPathScopeName.

    \returns A valid user data wave ID if successful, NULL if it
    is not. If this is an alias (the CarbonClientData was already

    performance.

    If carbonSchedule() has not yet been called or if dumping has been

    \note Deposits, in general, do not take effect until the next

    Generally, this function is not required. However, it is useful if

    the net ID is no longer needed.

    However, freeing a net handle does not necessarily mean that the
    net has been freed in memory. It decrements a reference
    count. Once that reference count becomes 0, the net is freed in
    memory.

    Freeing a net has no effect on value change callbacks. A value
    change callback keeps a reference to the net. Therefore, change
    callbacks will continue to work and a valid net handle will be
    passed into the callback routine.
