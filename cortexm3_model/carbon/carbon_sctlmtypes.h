//! Forward declaration of clock generator
template <unsigned int BUSWIDTH> class CarbonScGatedClock;

//! The following class redirects all activity on a single interface to a parent class
/*! A component may have more than one slave interface, and if there
 *  is activity on any of them, the component should be woken up. This
 *  class redirects the activity for a single interface to a common
 *  clock generator.
 *
 *  This class is based off the GreenSocs gs::socket::gp_observer_base
 *  class. That class requires that the four virtual callback
 *  functions nb_call_callback, nb_return_callback, b_call_callback,
 *  and b_return_callback get overloaded. Those are the four events
 *  that are monitored and when they occur, it results in calls to the
 *  CarbonScGatedClock functions: transactionStart() and
 *  transactionEnd().
 *
 *  Note that this is just one possible way to activate/deactivate the
 *  clock generator. Another possibility is to only activate the clock
 *  on transaction start events. In that case the code should call the
 *  CarbonScGatedClock::wakeup() function and the transaction count
 *  feature will not be used.

 *  if the idle timer should start immediately after the transaction
 *  starts and use the latter if the idle timer should start after the
 *  transaction completes.
 *
 *  The idle timer starts counting down whenever the transaction count
 *  is 0 and the clocks are active. The idle timer counts down once
 *  per clock posedge. Once the idle timer is 0, it checks the model
 *  idle signal. If it is high the clock is disabled.
